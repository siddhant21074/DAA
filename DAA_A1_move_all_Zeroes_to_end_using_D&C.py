#  Given an array of random numbers, Push all the zeroâ€™s
# of a given array to the end of the array. For example, if the given
# arrays is {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}, it should be changed to {1, 9,
# 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}. The order of all other elements should be
# same.
# Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0};
# Output : arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0};
